\abstract{Using language requires speakers and listeners to make pragmatic inferences that extend beyond the literal sense of an utterance. For example, adult listeners quickly and easily infer from the statement ``\textit{Some} of the cookies are oatmeal raisin'' that the others might not be. Children however have more difficulty with this statement and often fail to make scalar implicatures using quantifiers. Children's performance varies tremendously across studies and tasks however, limiting the number of possible direct comparisons between datasets. To address this issue, we designed a novel experimental paradigm, which both minimized task demands for participants, and enabled comparisons across different tasks. In Experiment 1, we explored children's computation of both ad-hoc (contextual) and scalar (quantifier) implicatures, and found that while older 4-year-olds succeeded with ad-hoc descriptions, they still performed poorly with quantifier descriptions. Intriguingly, we also found bimodal and correlated performance with the quantifiers ``some'' and ``none''. In Experiment 2, we attempted to isolate children's sources of difficulty with these terms by including only scalar trials, and found that while performance increased, children's performance remained low for ``some'' and ``none'' trials. In Experiment 3, we explored possible sources of developmental difficulty in this task. Inhibitory control did not predict children's ability to make scalar implicatures. Rather, we found that children who had difficulty with ``some'' and ``none'' in an implicature task made similar errors in a quantifier knowledge task. Taken together, our results provide more detailed developmental data on the development of pragmatic implicatures, and suggest that difficulty with scalar implicatures may in fact be rooted in a lack of quantifier knowledge.

\section{Introduction}
%A cooperative speaker is one that produces utterances that are informative given their intended meaning. An implicature is an instance in which a weaker literal description (e.g., ``I ate some of the cookies'') implies that a stronger alternative (that I ate \emph{all} is not true, or else the cooperative speaker would have used the stronger description. \emph{Scalar} implicatures are ones that rely on lexical scales, or sets of related terms that are graded in meaning such as quantifiers (``some'' vs. ``all''), modals (``possibly'' vs. ``definitely''), logical connectives (``or'' vs. ``and'') and numerals (``one'' vs. ``two'') \cite{horn1972}. \emph{Ad-hoc} implicatures are contextually week descriptions that negate stronger interpretations (e.g., ``I ate the sugar cookies'' implies that I \emph{only} ate the sugar cookies, and not the other varieties available). \footnote{While \citeA{grice1975logic} distinguished ``generalized'' and ``particularized'' implicatures, this distinction has been controversial. Here we use ``ad-hoc implicature'' as a term of convenience to describe contextually-supported inferences while remaining agnostic about the theoretical distinction.}   While scalar and ad-hoc implicatures are similar in nature and simple for adults, they are often challenging for children. We investigate factors influencing children's pragmatic inferences across these types of descriptions.

Adult language users effortlessly make inferences that go beyond the literal sense of an utterance. For example, an adult who hears ``I ate \emph{some} of the cookies'' would expect that the speaker did not eat \emph{all} the cookies. Similarly, that adult would infer from the utterance ``I ate the sugar cookies,'' that the speaker ate \emph{only} the sugar cookies, and not the other varieties. Both statements use a weaker literal description to imply that a stronger alternative is true. The first requires the listener to make what is known as a scalar implicature, which relies on lexical scales such as quantifiers (``some'' vs. ''all'') or modals (``possibly'' vs. ``definitely'') \cite{horn1972}. The second statement necessitates an ad-hoc or contextual implicature, in which a stronger description is negated by a contextually weaker description.\footnote{While \citeA{grice1975logic} distinguished ``generalized'' and ``particularized'' implicatures, this distinction has been controversial. Here we use ``ad-hoc implicature'' as a term of convenience to describe contextually-supported inferences while remaining agnostic about the theoretical distinction.} Previous research has suggested that while children are able to make ad-hoc implicatures, they experience difficulty in computing scalar implicatures. Thus, they would have trouble inferring from ``I ate \emph{some} of the cookies'' that (a few) cookies still remain. Here, we explore the developmental trajectory of children's ability to make both ad-hoc and scalar implicatures using a novel paradigm, and investigate factors influencing children's performance across quantifier descriptions. 

Children's processing of scalar implicatures is an intriguing case study in pragmatic development. In contrast to adults' spontaneous computation of scalar implicatures along quantifier lexical scales like  $<${\sc some, all}$>$, children's performance on these same scales is variable even until fairly late in development \cite{noveck2001}. It is possible however that some of the paradigms used to test implicature comprehension in children might obscure their pragmatic abilities, such as ones that require children to make truth judgments for complex propositions. In fact, children show a graded pattern of successes and failures across different tasks \cite{guasti2005,papafragou2003, papafragou2004}. For example, five-year-olds asked to rate the felicity of a statement by selecting the magnitude of a reward (rather than making a binary true/false decision) assigned only mid-sized rewards for true but pragmatically odd descriptions \cite{katsos2011}, suggesting that they do recognize that weak statements are less felicitous than stronger ones. The wide range of methods and measures used to assess children's ability to compute implicatures also does not allow for many direct comparisons in children's performance across different tasks. 

In (Table \ref{tab:lit_review}), we present a brief review of developmental implicature research. This is a non-exhaustive review, but does capture the wide range of paradigms and dependent variables across studies. In this literature, we found that most studies targeted relatively narrow age bins (12--18 months, although several are wider, see cf. \citeNP{papafragou2004}). Aside from the various methods used to assess implicatures, we observed several differences which may contribute to children's variable performance. For example, we found differing syntactic structure in scalar implicature prompts: recent work indicates that the use of the partitive is a particularly strong cue for scalar implicatures \cite{degen2014}. Further, paradigms also differed in the availability of both lexical and visual alternatives, both of which have been shown to facilitate implicature computation \cite{stiller2014}. In sum, the diversity of measures across these different studies may contribute to observed inconsistencies in children's performance, as many things in context affect the strength of scalar implicatures \cite{degen2015}. Across these studies however, children's difficulty with scalar implicatures suggests that their fragile performance might have less to do with general pragmatic knowledge per se, and more to do with their knowledge of particular scales. 

The \emph{Alternatives Hypothesis}, proposed by Barner and colleagues \cite{barner2010, barner2011}, posits that children's ability to compute scalar implicatures relies on their recognition of the relevant lexical alternatives and familiarity with these scales (e.g., that use of the weaker term ``some'' conveys a direct contrast with the stronger alternative ``all'', thus implying \emph{some but not all}). In other words, children's pragmatic inferences rely on their ability to consider relevant possible alternative word choices that could have been used in place of the ones the speaker chose. So even in supportive paradigms, if children cannot bring to mind ``all'' when reasoning about ``some,'' they will fail to make an implicature.

Previous research supports this hypothesis, with children's performance in implicature tasks increasing when they have stronger access to lexical alternatives. Evaluating performance in competitions where alternative outcomes are salient \cite{papafragou2003} and using contextually-accessible (ad-hoc) scales (e.g., ``the cat and the cow are sleeping'' rather than ``some animals are sleeping''; \citeNP{barner2011}) both help preschoolers make implicatures. The Alternatives Hypothesis also predicts interactions between the supportiveness of a task and children's performance. For example, even older three-year-olds show evidence of computing implicatures for ad-hoc contextualized scales when the task is a referential forced choice between possible interpretations \cite{stiller2014}. Preschoolers also show some preliminary evidence of computing scalar implicatures for quantifiers in a similar forced-choice paradigm, albeit with prosodic support \cite{miller2005}. In sum, the Alternatives Hypothesis appears to provide a promising account of the current patterns of preschoolers' successes and failures in pragmatic implicature tasks.

%Nevertheless, work to date has varied widely in the particular scales, tasks, and measures used, as well as developmental samples that are relatively small while spanning several years of age. These concerns make it difficult to interpolate across findings and draw strong inferences about contrasts between contextually-supported (ad-hoc) and lexicalized (scalar) implicatures. In the current study, we create a paradigm which fills this gap, allowing exploration of children's processing of both ad-hoc and scalar implicatures with a single task.

With the Alternatives Hypothesis in mind, we designed a simple referent selection task in which children were asked to select which of three book covers they thought the experimenter was describing. This task gave children access to the visual alternatives in each trial (the three book covers) and the lexical alternatives across trials (ad-hoc or scalar descriptions). Our design allowed us to fully counterbalance the trial types (ad-hoc vs. scalar descriptions crossed with implicature vs. unambiguous control targets) across participants, to examine both within-subject patterns of responses and between-subject developmental patterns, and to reduce the demands of the task by having children select the implied referent among three visual alternatives.

In Experiment 1, we included both ad-hoc and scalar descriptions with implicature and control trials for each. Four--year-olds were at ceiling on ad-hoc trials \cite<similar to previous work, e.g.>{stiller2014}, but their performance on scalar implicature trials was very low. In Experiment 2, we omitted ad-hoc trials. We found developmental increases in performance for each trial type, with higher performance on implicature trials for 4-year-olds in this scalar-only version of the task. In both Experiments 1 and 2, we found an unexpected result: Children's pattern of responses on scalar implicature trials was bimodal and strongly correlated with their performance on ``none'' (scalar control) trials. This correlation suggested a general source of scalar implicature failure in development. In Experiment 3, we explored two alternatives (inhibitory control and lack of quantifier knowledge) that could cause children's failures with the quantifiers ``some'' and ``none''. Overall, our findings suggest that while preschoolers' computation of scalar implicatures can be supported by stronger recognition of the lexical alternatives, their failure in making these implicatures may be rooted in difficulty comprehending and contrasting relevant quantifiers.

\section{Experiment 1: Ad-hoc and scalar implicature computation in children}

Given the difficulty equating results on children's computation of implicatures across different methods and paradigms, we created a single task that could be adapted to investigate both ad-hoc and scalar items in one task. This task involved one set of visual stimuli presented in the same order to all participants; however, the particular items (ad-hoc or scalar) queried were counterbalanced across participants. Thus, with one set of visual stimuli we could directly compare children's performance on both ad-hoc and scalar implicatures in a single experimental session. In Experiment 1, we included questions about ad-hoc and scalar implicatures,. While we found that this paradigm was appropriate for ad-hoc items, children still struggled computing scalar items.\footnote{All stimuli, data, and analyses are available in a public repository at \small{\tt{http://github.com/rosemschneider/si\_paper}}.} In all scalar items, we used a partitive construction to increase the likelihood of making an implicature \cite{degen2014}. 

% In Experiment 2, we included only scalar items in the task, and found that participants were moderately more successful at making implicatures when these trials were presented in isolation. In Experiment 3, we explored two alternatives potentially driving children's difficulties in this task. 

\subsection{Methods}

\subsubsection{Participants} A planned sample of 48 children was recruited from a university preschool. These children were drawn from two age groups: twenty-four 4.0 -- 4.5-year-olds (M = 4;2, median = 4.19, SD = 0.14) and twenty-four 4.5 -- 5.0-year-olds (M = 4.74, median = 4.73, SD = .16). Two children were excluded from the final sample for not completing the task, and one additional child was excluded due to experimenter error. All participants' primary language was English, and no child completed more than one session of the task. 

\subsubsection{Stimuli}
Experimental stimuli consisted of a set of three printed pictures of book covers, each featuring four familiar items. In each trial, one book cover contained four items of the same kind (e.g., four cats), another book cover contained four items of another kind (e.g., dogs), and the final cover contained two items of a new set and two items repeated from one of the other book covers (e.g., two birds and two cats). An example of the stimuli can be seen in Figure \ref{fig:demo}. All items on the book covers were familiar to children, and were able to be identified. All participants saw the book covers in the same order.

  \caption{\label{fig:demo} Example trial stimuli used in all experiments. Children received a clue from the experimenter about which book she had in mind and responded based solely on the clue; this was either an ad-hoc or a scalar description of a book with either an unambiguous or implicature target.} 
 \end{center} 
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Procedure}
Participants were tested in individual sessions in a quiet room at their nursery school. The experimenter introduced the study as a guessing game, and explained that the child would receive a hint about which book cover the experimenter had in mind. The experimenter emphasized that the child would only receive one clue about what book the experimenter was describing, and she had to use that clue to make her decision. All participants saw the book covers in the same order; however, three scripts with both ad-hoc and scalar trials were counterbalanced across participants. Table \ref{tab:scripts} shows the breakdown of trial types and sample scripts.

 \end{table*}
 

Prior to the test trials, children were familiarized to the task with a practice trial with three book covers, each displaying a single unique and familiar item. During the practice trial, the experimenter told the child ``On the cover of my book, there's a TV.''. After children successfully completed the practice, they saw 18 test trials. At the start of every trial, the experimenter provided the child with either an ad-hoc or scalar description of one book and instruct the child to point to the book she was describing. If the child pointed to more than one book, or the response was otherwise ambiguous, the experimenter emphasized again that she was talking about just one book, and that they should choose the single book she was describing. 

In ad-hoc trials (eight total), the experimenter's descriptions of the target book used the names of the pictured objects, providing contextual support for the target. Ad-hoc control trials referred to an unambiguous target (e.g., ``On the cover of my book, there are dogs'' in Figure \ref{fig:demo}), while implicature trials required the child to reason about the speaker's meaning given an ambiguous utterance (e.g., ``On the cover of my book, there are cats'', which could refer to either the book containing only cats or the book containing cats and birds). In these critical trials, children had to understand that the speaker could potentially be talking about either the book with four or two of the named object, but that by opting to describe only one kind of object she was referring to the cover with four of the same object; otherwise, she would have mentioned both kinds of objects, or the ones unique to that cover (i.e., birds). 

In scalar trials (ten total), the experimenter described the target book with quantifiers. For scalar items, control trials referred to unambiguous targets with the quantifiers ``all'' and ``none'' (e.g., ``On the cover of my book, \textit{all/none} of the pictures are cats'') or an unambiguous referent of ``some'' (e.g., ``On the cover of my book, \textit{some} of the pictures are birds''). On critical scalar implicature trials, the experimenter used the weak quantifier ``some'' to reference the item pictured across two book covers (e.g., ``On the cover of my book, \textit{some} of the pictures are cats''). These trials required the child to reason that because the speaker used the weak quantifier ``some'', she must be referring to the book picturing only two of the named target, or else she would have used the stronger quantifier ``all''. 

All participants saw image sets in the same order; however, these image sets were counterbalanced for target location across the three scripts. Description condition and trial-type were further randomized across participants, and were spaced to avoid immediate repeat trial types. Children did not receive feedback after the test trial.

\subsection{Results}

\begin{figure}

 \end{center} 
\end{figure}

Children's accuracy on all trial types is plotted in Figure \ref{fig:exp1_perf}. In implicature trials, children's performance was coded as correct if they selected the image consistent with either the ad-hoc or scalar inference. Children were at ceiling making ad-hoc implicatures, which is consistent with previous research suggesting that children are able to succeed making such implicatures when they have access to the relevant lexical alternatives \cite{stiller2014}. Children's performance across ad-hoc trials provides strong evidence that our novel paradigm is an appropriate measure for such items.

In contrast to their success in making ad-hoc implicatures, children struggled in scalar trials. Although they succeeded in ``all'' and ``unambiguous some'' trials, children performed at chance on ``some'' (scalar implicature) trials (4--4.5-year-olds: \emph{t}(22) = .36, \emph{p} = .72; 4.5--5-year-olds: \emph{t}(24) = -2, \emph{p} =  .06) and at chance on ``none'' trials (4--4.5-year-olds: \emph{t}(22) = -.9, \emph{p} = .4; 4.5--5-year-olds: \emph{t}(24) = 1.6, \emph{p} = .13).

In a planned analysis, we ran a logistic mixed effects model, predicting a correct response as an interaction of age, condition (ad-hoc or scalar) and trial type (implicature or control), with random effects of participant and trial type. We found that performance was slightly lower for scalar trials than ad-hoc trials ($\beta$= --8.02, \textit{p} = .09), and that there was a significant interaction between condition and trial type, such that performance was significantly worse on scalar implicature trials ($\beta$= 16.07, \textit{p} \textless  .02). We also found a significant 3-way interaction between condition, trial type, and age, such that performance on scalar implicature trials decreased with age ($\beta$ = --4.16, \textit{p} \textless  .01). There were no significant effects of adding trial order (trials in the first half vs. second half of the experiment), indicating that performance did not change throughout the course of the experiment.

 \end{center} 
\end{figure}

In post-hoc analysis of the data, we found an unpredicted consistency in performance on ``some'' and ``none'' trials (Figures \ref{fig:imp_hist} and \ref{fig:none_hist}).\footnote{We also observed this bimodal performance in a pilot sample (N = 23), and found that it replicated in Experiment 1.}  To examine this patterns of responses more closely, we ran Hartigan's dip test and found significant bimodal distributions for both ``some''(\textit{D} = .15, \textit{p} \textless  .0001) and ``none'' (\textit{D} = .20, \textit{p} \textless  .0001). This suggests children did not respond at chance in scalar trials, but consistently either correctly or incorrectly. Additionally, children's success on ``some'' and ``none'' trials was highly correlated (\textit{r} = .45, \textit{p} \textless  .001), such that children who performed better on ``some'' trials also tended to perform better on ``none'' trials (Figure \ref{fig:exp1_diffs}). Performance on ``none'' and ``all'' trials (\textit{r} = .11, \textit{p} = .45) and ``some'' and ``all'' trials (\textit{r} = .01, \textit{p} = .95) was not correlated. 

\subsection{Discussion}

The results of Experiment 1 indicated that while children were easily able to make ad-hoc, but not scalar implicatures in our task. This pattern of performance was puzzling, given both our efforts to reduce task demands and children's striking success in ad-hoc trials. Despite having access to both visual and lexical alternatives across the task, children were still at chance in making scalar implicatures. 

Even more intriguing was the unexpected developmental change we observed on ``none'' trials. We included ``none'' as an unambiguous control quantifier, but found that children performed at chance for this scalar term as well. These results are supported by previous work suggesting that even older preschoolers struggle with negation occurring in contexts without pragmatic support \cite{nordmeyer2014}. Given children's difficulty with ``none'' and the strong positive correlation between ``some'' and ``none'' trials, it is possible that making implicatures necessitates some familiarity with both ends of the quantifier scale (\textit{none -- some -- all}). An inability to use and contrast relevant alternatives along the lexical scale $<${\sc some, all}$>$ might lead to failure in computing scalar implicatures. In addition to understanding the extremes of the quantifier scale, two other possibilities -- namely, general lack of quantifier knowledge, and inhibitory control -- may also account for children's decreased performance on scalar items. 

However, it is possible that this pattern of performance stems from including both ad-hoc and scalar quantifier descriptions within one experimental session. Children's success on ad-hoc trials may have lead to a misinterpretation of  scalar descriptions (e.g., ``On the cover of my book, some of the pictures are cats'') to ad-hoc descriptions (``On the cover of my book, there are cats''). Presenting scalar descriptors in the same experimental session as other relevant and felicitous descriptions inhibits scalar implicature comprehension, even in adults, cf.\cite{degenalt2015}. 

To explore the whether children's performance on scalar trials was influenced by ad-hoc trials, we removed all ad-hoc trials from our task, and ran a scalar-only version of the the study.

\section{Experiment 2: Isolating scalar implicatures}
In Experiment 2, we pursued the possibility that children failed to make scalar implicatures as a result of competing ad-hoc descriptors in the same experimental session. Additionally, we expanded our target age-range to 3--5 years to more fully explore the developmental trajectory across implicature and control trials.

\subsection{Methods}
\subsubsection{Participants} 

We recruited a new sample of 50 participants from a university preschool: twelve 3.0--3.5-year-olds (M=3;4, median = 3.35, SD = 0.1), twelve 3.5--4.0-year-olds (M=3;8, median = 3.67, SD = .12), fourteen 4.0--4.5-year-olds (M=4;3, median = 4.24, SD = .1), and twelve 4.5--5.0-year-olds (M=4;8, median = 4.63, SD = .15). One additional child was excluded for stopping the task early.

\subsubsection{Stimuli}
Stimuli were identical to Experiment 1. The only changes made in experimental protocol were to the scripts;  all 18 test trials were converted to quantifier descriptions (Table \ref{tab:scripts}). In Experiment 2, the 18 test trials consisted of six control ``all'' trials (e.g., ``On the cover of my book, \textit{all} of the pictures are cats''), six ``none'' trials (e.g., ``...\textit{none} of the pictures are cats''), and six ``some'' (scalar implicature) trials (``...\textit{some} of the pictures are cats''). We removed the unambiguous ``some'' trials to more effectively counterbalance; in ``some'' trials, the quantifier always referenced the item pictured across two book covers (e.g., in Figure \ref{fig:demo}, children heard references to ``none,'' ``some,'' or ``all'' cats). As in Experiment 1, image sets were presented in a fixed order, counterbalanced for both target location and triad order. Participants were randomly assigned to one of three scripts, with a pseudo-randomized trial order such that every book set was referred to by each quantifier type, and the same trial type never immediately repeated.

\subsubsection{Procedure}
The procedure was identical to Experiment 1. 

\subsection{Results}

In Experiment 2, children's performance over all trial types increased with age (Figure \ref{fig:exp2_perf}). Performance was highest in ``all'' trials, with all age groups significantly above chance (\emph{p} $<$ .05 for all tests). However, performance was still low in both ``none'' and ``some'' trials, with only 4.5--5-year-olds performing above chance for ``none'' trials (\textit{t}(11) = 3.09, \textit{p} $<$ .01) and only marginally above chance in ``some'' trials (\textit{t}(11) = 1.85, \textit{p} $<$ .09). Children's performance in Experiment 2 was not significantly different than in Experiment 1, in independent sample t-tests by trial type between age groups in both experiments (\emph{p} $>$ .09 for all tests). All of these tests were relatively low in power  however, due to the small number of individuals in each bin.

  \caption{\label{fig:exp2_perf} Proportion of correct responses by each age group across all scalar trial types. Error bars show 95\% confidence intervals computed by non-parametric bootstrap.} 
 \end{center} 
\end{figure}


To aggregate across groups, we ran a planned logistic mixed effects model, predicting correct responses as an interaction of age and trial type (\textit{all, some}, or \textit{none}), with random effects of trial type by participant. The only significant effect that emerged was age, such that performance increased across trials as children got older ($\beta$ = 20, \textit{p} \textless  .001). Adding trial order (first or second half of the experiment) to the model did not interact with any of the variables, indicating the performance did not change over the course of the experiment. We suspected that this lack of a main effect was due to individual variability, such as in Experiment 1. 

Consistent with the findings from Experiment 1, we  ran Hartigan's dip test and again found significant bimodal patterns of responses for both ``some'' (\textit{D} = .12, \textit{p} \textless  .0001) and ``none'' (\textit{D} = .15, \textit{p} \textless  .0001) trials. Once again, these trial types were highly correlated with one another (\textit{r} = .52, \textit{p} \textless  .001). Thus, as an exploratory analysis, we ran another version of the mixed effects model removing the random effect of trial type, as this model does not find trial type effects due to correlation observed between trial types.\footnote{Model formula: \small{\tt{(correct $\sim$ trial type * age + (1 | subject))}}} In addition to a main effect of age (\textit{t} = 1.88, \textit{p} \textless  .01), this model revealed a conditional effect: ``some'' trials were lower than ``all'' trials (\textit{t} = --7.69, \textit{p} \textless  .01), and marginally reduced from ``none'' trials (\textit{t} = 3.03, \textit{p} = .09). It also showed interactions between trial type and age, such that there was a greater difference between younger children's performance on ``some'' and ``all'' trials (\textit{t} = 2.84, \textit{p} \textless  .001), and ``some'' and ``none'' trials (\textit{t} = 0.90, \textit{p} = .05). Overall, we observed large individual variability in children's performance, with mean trends of children struggling with the quantifiers ``some'' and ``none'' in relation to ``all.''

  \caption{\label{fig:exp2_wrong} Children's selections on incorrect trials, faceted by trial type (``all,'' ``some,'' and ``none''). Graph shows the count of children choosing an incorrect alternative.} 
 \end{center} 
\end{figure}

In a further exploratory analysis, we investigated the particular kinds of errors that children made in ``some'' and ``none'' trials (Figure \ref{fig:exp2_wrong}). We found that children selected the correct noun on both kinds of trials, and chose the ``all'' option more frequently. This pattern of performance suggests that children either ``listened through'' (or disregarded) the quantifier (i.e., an issue of inhibitory control), or misunderstood what the quantifier meant (i.e., a lack of quantifier knowledge). 


\subsection{Discussion}

In Experiment 1, we observed success in children's computation of ad-hoc, but not scalar implicatures. To explore whether children's performance in making scalar implicatures was hindered by the presence of both ad-hoc and scalar items in the same session, we excluded ad-hoc items. When faced with only scalar descriptions, children's performance was numerically (although not significantly) better than in Experiment 1, with scalar implicature success positively correlated with age. We still observed low performance in ``some'' and ``none'' trials. Additionally, we again found bimodal and correlated patterns of responses in these two trials, with children consistently failing or succeeding in both ``some'' and ``none'' trials. 

The results of Experiment 2 indicated that children struggle with making scalar implicatures beyond dealing with competing contextual descriptors. The cause of this failure is not clear however, and individuals differ substantially. One possible explanation is that children's knowledge of the full quantifier scale is not yet adult-like in their preschool years, and the meanings of these scalar terms may yet be established. Another possibility is that children's performance might suffer on these task from developing inhibitory control, with children unable to overcome the impulse to select the target noun, regardless of quantifier. We explored these two alternatives in Experiment 3, including measures of both inhibitory control and quantifier knowledge in the same session.

\section{Experiment 3: Inhibitory control and quantifier knowledge measures}

In Experiments 1 and 2, we observed preschoolers' consistent and correlated lower performance in comprehending the quantifiers ``some'' and ``none'' on a scalar implicature task. In Experiment 3, we targeted two possible factors possibly driving this pattern of results: lack of quantifier knowledge, and inhibitory control. In an individual differences paradigm, we supplemented our implicature task with an inhibitory control task, the Dimensional Change Card Sort (DCCS) \cite{zelazo2006}, and a quantifier-knowledge task, Give-Quantifier \cite{barner2009}. The DCCS is a standard executive function measure that requires children to shift tasks midway through the task (e.g., sorting cards based on shape rather than color). Children's performance in the DCCS (i.e., their ability to task switch) is a reliable measure of their inhibitory control \cite{zelazo2006}. In the Give-Quantifier task, a productive measure of quantifier knowledge, children give a quantity of items in response to a quantifier prompt. Thus, with these two tasks, we can assess the contributions of both quantifier knowledge and inhibitory control in driving children's observed performance in our scalar implicature task.

\subsection{Methods}
\subsubsection{Participants} We recruited a new planned sample of 72 children from a university preschool; this sample was selected to have 80\% power to detect correlations of \emph{r} $>$ .3. Once again, we included children from 3--5 years: eighteen 3--3.5-year-olds (M = 3.23, median = 3.24, SD = 0.13), eighteen 3.5--4-year-olds (M = 3.73, median = 3.8, SD = 0.18), eighteen 4--4.5-year-olds (M= 4.16, median = 4.11, SD = 0.11), and eighteen 4.5--5-year-olds (M = 4.7, median = 4.68 SD = 0.14). Twelve children additional were recruited but excluded from the final sample for having participated in either Experiments 1 or 2. Nine children asked for a break, and completed one of the three tasks in a subsequent testing session. 

\subsubsection{Stimuli} Stimuli for the implicature task were identical to Experiment 2. The materials for the DCCS, our inhibitory control measure, drawn from the original methods paper \cite{zelazo2006}. Fourteen laminated sorting (7 red rabbits and 7 blue boats) were put into two plastic sorting trays marked with either a target blue rabbit or red boat. To assess quantifier knowledge, we used the Give-Quantifier task \cite{barner2009}. Stimuli for this task consisted of three different sets of plastic fruits (8 oranges, 8 bananas, and 8 strawberries) and a red plastic plate. Fruits were grouped together by kind at the start of each trial. 

\subsubsection{Procedure}
The procedure for our implicature task was identical to Experiment 2. Task order was counterbalanced across participants, and individual scripts for each task were also counterbalanced to avoid order effects. The tasks were done in a small room apart from the main classroom in individual sessions. The experimenter asked the child before the start of every task whether she would like to play the game or return to the classroom. 

We drew our protocol for DCCS directly from the original methods paper \cite{zelazo2006}. In running the Give-Quantifier task, we followed the protocol of the original study \cite{barner2009}, with the exception of limiting the quantifiers used in the task to ``some,'' ``all,'' ``none,'' and ``most.'' The experimenter used the partitive construction and prosodically emphasized the quantifier across all trials (e.g., ``Can you put \textit{all} of the bananas into the plate?''). Quantifiers were presented in two different orders between participants, and fruit-quantifier pairings were quasi-randomized such that the same pairing was not repeated within a session. If the child requested clarification, the experimenter repeated the prompt, and added that the child should put however many pieces of fruit she felt should go on the plate. 

In coding the results of the Give-Quantifier task, we relied on the original coding scheme \cite{barner2009}; ``all'' and ``none'' trials were coded as correct for 8 and 0 pieces of fruit given respectively; ``some'' trials were coded as correct if the child gave between 2 and 7 pieces, and ``most'' trials were correct if the child gave between 5 and 7 pieces. 

\subsection{Results}

  \caption{\label{fig:exp3_perf} Proportion of correct responses by each age group across all scalar trial types. Error bars show 95\% confidence intervals computed by non-parametric bootstrap.} 
 \end{center} 
\end{figure}

We again replicated children's performance on our implicature task (Figure \ref{fig:exp3_perf}); independent sample t-tests between performance in Experiments 2 and 3 within age-groups did not yield any significant differences (\emph{p} $>$ .1 for all tests) except for 4--4.5-year-olds' performance on ``all'' trials, which was significantly lower in Experiment 3 (\emph{t}(30) = 2.16, \emph{p} $<$ .05), but still above chance. Once again, we found that performance increased with age. All age groups were above chance in ``all'' trials, except for 3--3.5-year-olds, who were at chance (\emph{t}(17)= 1.52, \emph{p} = .15).  Only 4.5--5-year-olds performed significantly above chance on ``none'' trials, (\emph{t}(17) = 2.93, \emph{p} $<$ .01), but still performed near chance on ``some'' trials (\emph{t}(17) = 1.44 \emph{p} = .2). As in Experiment 2, we ran Hartigan's dip test in a post-hoc analysis and again found a significant bimodal distribution of performance in both ``some'' (\textit{D} = .07, \textit{p} = .002) and ``none'' trials (\textit{D} = .15, \textit{p} $>$ .0001). Performance with these two quantifiers was also significantly positively correlated (\emph{r} = .4, \emph{p} $<$ .001). Because children's performance was so highly correlated with age, we ran a partial correlation controlling for age, and found these trial types were still significantly correlated (\emph{r} = .3, \emph{p} $<$ .01).

 \end{center} 
\end{figure}

We next turned to whether children's lower and correlated performance on ``some'' and ``none'' trials was due to an inhibitory control issue (i.e., making a response based solely on the target noun, regardless of quantifier used.) Accuracy on the DCCS is plotted in Figure \ref{fig:exp3_DCCS}. Overall, we found lower performance in post-switch trials for all age groups, with a developmental increase in performance from three to five years of age. Performance on post-switch trials was significantly correlated with age (\textit{r} = .28, \textit{p} = .018), with 3--3.5-year-olds at chance (\emph{t}(only 4--5-year-olds performing significantly better than chance (4--4.5-year-olds: \emph{t}(18) = 3.05, \emph{p} $<$ .01; 4.5--5-year-olds: \emph{t}(16) = 3.31, \emph{p} $< $.01). After controlling for age, we did not find a significant correlation between inhibitory control and performance on either ``some'' (\textit{r} = .13, \textit{p} = .26) or ``none'' trials (\textit{r} = - .01, \textit{p} = .93) in our implicature task.

 \end{center} 
\end{figure}

Next, we turned our attention the relationship between children's performance on our scalar implicature task and quantifier knowledge. Children's performance on the Give-Quantifier task was very similar to performance on our implicature task, with all age groups performing at ceiling for the quantifier ``all'', and only older children succeeding on``most,'' ``none,'' and ``some'' quantifier trials. Figure \ref{fig:GQ_spread} shows the breakdown of how children responded to these scalar terms. We collapsed across all age groups and found a significant bimodal distribution of responses through Hartigan's dip test in both ``some'' (\emph{D} = .19, \emph{p} $<$ .0001) and ``none'' trials (\emph{D} = .15, \emph{p} $<$ .0001). In an exploratory analysis, we ran dip tests by age group, and found that this effect was primarily driven in ``some'' trials by 3--3.5-year-olds (\emph{D} = .14, \emph{p} $<$ .0004) and 4--4.5-year-olds (\emph{D} = .13, \emph{p} $<$ .004), and in ``none'' trials by 3--3.5-year-olds (\emph{D} = .21, \emph{p} $<$ .0001) and 3.5--4-year-olds (\emph{D} = .2, \emph{p} $<$ .0001). Overall, we found that younger children showed a bimodal and correlated pattern of response to the quantifier ``none,'' with the majority of children giving either 0 or all 8 items in these trials, and gradually shifting to the correct response by 4.5--5 years. Similar to performance on ``some'' trials in our scalar implicature task, we found that younger children gave all 8 objects in response to the prompt ``some,'' and only the oldest age groups gave a more adult-like distribution of items in response. In a partial correlation controlling for age, we found that performance in ``none'' and ``some'' trials was significantly correlated (\textit{r} = .61, \textit{p} \textless .0001).

  \caption{\label{fig:exp3_wrong} Count of children choosing an alternative on incorrect trials, faceted by trial type (``all,'' ``some,'' and ``none'') and split by age group.} 
 \end{center} 
\end{figure}

In a further exploration of the relationship between quantifier knowledge and scalar implicature performance, we examined both the particular kinds of errors that children made across both tasks, and how they were related. Figure \ref{fig:exp3_wrong} shows the breakdown of children's performance in our scalar implicature task on incorrect trials. As in Experiment 2, children exhibited evidence of making selections based solely on the target noun, regardless of the quantifier used. This result closely mirrors children's performance in our Give-Quantifier task (Figure \ref{fig:GQ_spread}), in which younger children responded in a bimodal fashion for the items ``some'' and ``none.'' 

In partial-correlations controlling for age, we found that performance on our Give-Quantifier and implicature tasks were correlated: children who tended to struggle with scalar terms in the context of implicatures also had lower performance when asked to produce a number of items in response to a quantifier prompt, specifically on ``some''  (\textit{r} = .27, \textit{p} $<$ .02) and ``none'' trials in both tasks {\textit{r} = .52, \textit{p} \textless .0001). We did not find a significant correlation with performance on ``some'' scalar implicature and ``none'' Give-Quantifier trials (\textit{r} = .18, \textit{p} = .14), although we did find a relation between performance on ``none'' scalar implicature and ``some'' Give-Quantifier trials (\textit{r} = .35, \textit{p} = .002). 



\subsection{Discussion}

In Experiment 3, we explored potential factors behind children's difficulty making scalar implicatures, as well as with comprehension of the quantifier ``none.'' We combined two tasks targeting specific hypothesized areas of difficulty (inhibitory control and lack of quantifier knowledge) with our implicature paradigm in a within-subjects design to explore the relationship amongst these abilities. While we found that younger children did have difficulties in our inhibitory control task, we did not find a significant relation between performance in this task and inhibitory control, at least at the .3 level that we had power to detect.

We did find that children's performance on the Give-Quantifier and scalar implicature tasks were related however, and children who failed ``some'' and ``none'' trials tended to do so across both tasks. This result indicates that quantifiers may be particularly difficult for children, even when removed from the pragmatically challenging scalar implicature context. While it is clear that children struggle with quantifier comprehension, the source of this developmental difficulty is less clear. There is research indicating that quantifiers are a difficult class of linguistic expression to acquire, due to their non-exact and varying corresponding set sizes \cite{hurewitz2009}. Because children's definitions of these scalar terms are not solidified in the pre-school years, it is possible that that they are not able to use and contrast quantifiers on the $<${\sc none -- some -- all}$>$ scale to succeed in make a scalar implicature. It is also possible that the pragmatic contexts in which these quantifiers occur are particularly difficult to process.

\section{General Discussion}

We designed a simple task to investigate patterns of pragmatic development both within- and between-subjects. We minimized task demands by asking participants to select the speaker's intended referent from among three visual alternatives. In Experiment 1, we replicated the finding that preschoolers can compute ad-hoc implicatures \cite{stiller2014}, though we found poor performance on scalar implicatures. In Experiment 2, we removed competing ad-hoc descriptions from our implicature task, and found marginal increases in preschoolers' comprehension of all scalar quantifier terms. We still observed correlated difficulty with the quantifiers ``some'' and ``none,'' however. In Experiment 3, we explored two possible explanations for this pattern of performance, inhibitory control and quantifier knowledge, and found evidence that children's difficulties on our implicature task are rooted in a lack of quantifier knowledge, rather than inhibitory control. Our findings suggest that while 4-year-olds are able to compute scalar implicatures with support from contextual cues, but their performance is fragile and is inhibited by an unestablished quantifier scale.

Our work contributes to the existing literature in a number of ways. First, it offers a novel paradigm that is less complicated than many other implicature tasks, leading us to feel more confident that our results reflect children's true sensitivity rather than inadvertent task demands. Each test set remained visible to children, and they were merely asked to select which picture they thought was the referent corresponding to the speaker's description. Second, the relatively high number of trials for each participant both helped strengthen our analytical power and also offered the possibility for children to identify lexical alternatives as the study progressed. Third, we were able not only to compare performance across age groups, but also to examine individual patterns of responses across the different trial types. This design helped us determine that preschoolers' performance on scalar implicature trials was bimodal and highly related to their performance on ``none'' trials, which we would have been unlikely to uncover in a purely between-subjects implicature design without controls. Finally, we were able to test two hypotheses about the sources of children's difficult with scalar implicatures, and rule out inhibitory control as a reason for failure.

Our findings also provide support for the Alternatives Hypothesis \cite{barner2010,barner2011}. First, our ad-hoc trials in Experiment 1 show that preschoolers had no difficulty generally making inferences about contextual descriptions when alternative nominal descriptions were obvious from the context. Performance on scalar trials also appeared to be related to the recognition of a broad set of lexical alternatives, due to both preschoolers' increasing ability to compute scalar implicatures with age (presumably a proxy for familiarity with scalemates) and due to the difference in performance across Experiments 1 and 2. These results support the idea that children's ability to compute implicatures relates to their ability to reason about what other possible utterances a speaker could have used instead. On the other hand, one pattern in our data was more difficult to reconcile with the Alternatives Hypothesis: Children's performance did not change over the course of either experiment. We had expected that, if children's difficulties with scalar implicature were due to a lack of recognition of the contrastive relationship between ``some'' and ``all,'' that this relationship would be revealed by the two words' consistent use in contrasting references over the course of the many trials that each child completed  \cite{skordos2014}. The lack of trial order effects we observed could indicate that children in our task did not yet have strong enough comprehension of these terms for contrastive use to matter, or alternatively that our referent-selection task eliminated the problem of summoning the contrasting term to mind and instead foregrounded some other inferential challenge (perhaps that of inhibitory control). 

The correlated responses for``some'' and ``none'' trials in both Experiments 1 and 2 presented a particularly interesting puzzle, and suggested that children's difficulty with these quantifiers could have a common root, either in quantifier knowledge or inhibitory control.  ``None'' is not typically considered part of the same Horn scale as ``some'' and ``all'' (because ``all'' entails ``some,'' but ``some'' does not entail ``none''---and in fact entails the opposite), but it is nonetheless a lexical contrast along the same quantifier scale. One possibility is that children's knowledge of the whole quantifier scale plays a role in scalar implicature, though knowledge of logically-false alternatives is not involved in the computations outlined by most theoretical accounts \cite<e.g.>{barner2011}. Another is that performance on ``none'' and ``some'' trials may be correlated because both scalar implicature and negation comprehension might require inhibiting another response---the positive alternative in the negative case, and the stronger alternative in the implicature case. We explored these two alternatives in Experiment 3, and found support for the possibility that quantifier knowledge, rather than inhibitory control, drives this correlation between children's responses with the quantifiers ``some'' and ``none.''

Several limitations in the current study provide direction for further work. First ,we did not record children's response time on the scalar implicature task. In conducting this study, we observed that some children took longer to respond to the prompt than others. It is possible that a response latency measure might yield more information about the particular processing and inhibitory demands that these implicatures entail. Additionally, our quantifier knowledge measure \cite{barner2009} may present many of the same pragmatic hurdles as our implicature task. For example, the syntactic construction of prompts in Give-Quantifier are very similar (e.g., ``Can you put \emph{some} of the oranges on the plate?'' vs. ``On the cover of my book, \emph{some} of the pictures are oranges.'') Future work will pursue response latencies as an alternative measure of inhibitory control in addition to exploring to what extent children's difficulty with ``some'' and ``none'' are the result of challenging pragmatic contexts. While our results indicate that children's failure in scalar implicature tasks may have a root in absent quantifier knowledge, it is still very likely that the sources of developmental difficulty with implicatures come from several areas.

% 'the cognitive control to select the appropriate implied referent. 
%INHIBITORY CONTROL? 

%though suggests that there may be more to the picture of children's ability to compute scalar implicatures. Our ad-hoc trials in Experiment 1 indicate that preschoolers had no difficulty making inferences about contextual descriptions, giving support that they evaluated the speaker's intended meaning when able to consider the possible descriptive choices for the visual alternatives; children tailored their selections to the speaker's most likely referent based on her choices of words given the potential items to be named in the scene. 

%For the scalar trials, we also see evidence that performance was based on recognition of lexical alternatives: preschoolers' ability to compute scalar implicatures increases with age (presumably a proxy for familiarity with these scalemates). Additionally, the correlated bimodal pattern of responses for \emph{some} and \emph{none} trials in both Experiments 1 and 2 indicates that children's inferences are related to their comprehension of related lexical alternatives. \emph{None} is not typically considered part of the same Horn scale as \emph{some} and \emph{all} (because ``all'' entails \emph{some}, but ``some'' does not entail \emph{none}---and in fact entails the opposite), but it is nonetheless a lexical contrast along the same quantifier scale. Overall, these patterns of results support the idea that children's ability to compute implicatures relates to their ability to consider what other possible utterance choices a speaker could have used instead. As children gain more experience with language and members of the same quantifier scale, they are more likely to succeed in making inferences about the implications of these particular word choices. 


 % were sensitive to opportunities for inferences based on contrasts in lexical choices, that their level of implicature performance should increase over the course of the experiment. In other words, because children comprehend ``all,'' they should infer that the speaker's choice to use ``all'' in some trials but ``some'' and ``none'' in others implies that she intends a reference other than \emph{all} by these alternative descriptions. This logic could be a lower-level lexical inference (that ``all'' and ``some'' or ``none'' should not overlap in meaning), or a pragmatic inference (that if the speaker has selectively used ``all'' on certain trials and uses ``some'' or ``none'' on other trials, she probably intended a different meaning by using these different terms). Either route to inference should make children more likely to select the picture that is \emph{not} ``all'' on \emph{some} and \emph{none} trials, leading to an increase in correct target selections for ``some'' (which still pictures the named item). 

% , do not recognize them as lexical alternatives, or do not perceive descriptive changes as indicators of contrast relevant to the context. 

% The simple pictures in our task may have also influenced children's ability to interpret the speaker's descriptions, as adults rate quantifier use for small numbers as less natural than for larger numbers \cite{degen2014b}. 


%Because we don't see a change in performance across trials, it may be the case that children need stronger lexical knowledge of particular terms before making inferences purely on contrastive word choice. It may not be enough just to hear that a speaker is using different words, and may be the case that children need more evidence about the particular meanings of these terms before they can demonstrate inferences about changes in their implied meaning. 


%In other words, even if children were not complete comprehenders of ``some'' and ``none'', they should realize that, across the first few trials, that if they know the meaning of \emph{all} (at which they perform near ceiling), then they should be able to make the inference that a change in quantifier (``some'' or ``none'' in place of ``all'') should indicate a change in meaning (that another quantifier should not \emph{also} refer to the picture of \emph{all}). 

% In sum, sensitivity to speaker's word choices can facilitate the information exchange between conversational patterers. 
% Implicatures are particularly useful instances of pragmatic inferences because they involve \emph{implied} meaning, offering opportunities for a inference with high likelihoods of success when recognized compared with more subtle uses of language. 
In sum, our work suggests that children can draw implicatures based on some lexical choices---such as in the case of ad-hoc implicatures---but they still struggle with quantifier-based scalar implicatures until relatively late. This difficulty is not confined to making scalar implicatures, but extends to children's knowledge of the quantifiers ``some'' and ``none''. The particular trouble with these quantifiers seems to be rooted in incomplete quantifier knowledge rather than inhibitory control. Once children understand the full quantifier scale, they can recognize the relevant category contrasts intended and compute implicatures from these quantifier word choices. 
% than the pragmatic cues of varying descriptive choices. Children may need to have a stronger comprehension of a lexical category before making inferences about possible within-category distinctions word choices convey. Once they can recognize the relevant category contrasts intended, they can compute implicatures from these word choices.
